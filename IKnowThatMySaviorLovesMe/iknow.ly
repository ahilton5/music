  A long time a -- go in a beau -- ti -- ful place, Child -- ren were ga -- thered 'round Je -- sus.
  He blessed and taught as they felt of His love.
  Each saw the tears on His face.
  The love that He felt for His lit -- tle ones I know He feels for me.
  I did not touch Him or sit on His knee,
  Yet, Jesus is real to me.
  I know He lives! I will follow faith -- ful -- ly.
  My heart I give to Him.
  I know that my Sav -- ior loves me.
  Now I am here in a beaut -- i --ful place, Learn -- ing the teach -- ings of Je -- sus.
  Par -- ents and teach -- ers will help guide the way, Light -- ing my path ev' -- ry day.
  Wrapped in the arms of my Sav -- ior's love, I feel His gen -- tle touch.
  Liv -- ing each day, I will fol -- low His way, Home to my Fa -- ther a -- bove.
  I know He lives!
  I will fol -- low faith -- ful -- ly.
  My heart I give to Him.
  I know that my Sav -- ior loves me.
  I know that my Sav -- ior loves me.
